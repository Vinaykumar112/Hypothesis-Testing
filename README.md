# Hypothesis-Testing
A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about a population which may or may not be true. Hypothesis testing is a set of formal procedures used by statisticians to either accept or reject statistical hypotheses. 
Statistical hypotheses are of two types:  
Null hypothesis, H0 - represents a hypothesis of chance basis. 
Alternative hypothesis, Ha - represents a hypothesis of observations which are influenced by some non-random cause.
